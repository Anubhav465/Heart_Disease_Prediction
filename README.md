Heart Disease Prediction Project:

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on key health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The model utilizes Python and its powerful libraries for data analysis and machine learning.

Features:

Data Analysis: Used Pandas and NumPy to clean, process, and analyze the dataset.
Machine Learning: Implemented Logistic Regression to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For implementing Logistic Regression.

Results:

Achieved an accuracy of 80% using Logistic Regression.

Future Scope:

Adding more advanced machine learning models for better accuracy.
Incorporating additional health parameters for a more comprehensive analysis.
